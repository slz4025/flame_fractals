# flame_fractals
Flame fractal generator.  This is an implementation of the process described at [Flam3](https://flam3.com).

This repo contains three files:
- PlasFrac: The main file, where the fractal image is generated.
- Funcs: The color handler for a particular function being used to generate the fractal.
- Variations: a small library of different generating functions.

I've used it to create test images like the following:
